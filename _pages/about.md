Hello and welcome to my GitHub portfolio! 

My name is Christian Magliano, and I am currently a PhD student in Astrophysics at the University of Naples. My academic journey and research interests revolve around some of the most fascinating aspects of the Universe:

- 🌍 **Exoplanets**: Discovering and studying planets beyond our Solar System, understanding their atmospheres, and assessing their potential habitability.
- 🌌 **Cosmology**: Exploring the large-scale structure of the universe, its origins, evolution, and ultimate fate.
- 👽 **Astrobiology**: Investigating the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe, combining knowledge from biology, chemistry, and planetary science.

During my PhD, I have honed a variety of valuable skills, particularly in the realms of data analysis and visualization. Here are some of the key skills I have developed:

- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Proficient in handling and analyzing large datasets, extracting meaningful patterns, and deriving scientific insights.
- 📉 **Data Visualization**: Skilled in creating clear and informative visual representations of complex data, helping to communicate findings effectively.
- 🧪 **Scientific Research**: Conducting rigorous and methodical research, formulating hypotheses, and testing them through experiments and observations.
- 💻 **Programming**: I learned programming with Python, developing various scripts and tools to aid in my research. I am experienced with libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy.

I am generally interested in Science and I love working with big data and working sheets. In particular, I have a basic knowledge of Machine Learning, Data Engineering and Statistics which allows me to conduct a Data Analysis project within any field (science, finance, marketing, sport).
In addition to my technical skills, I am passionate about sharing knowledge and collaborating with fellow researchers. I believe that the mysteries of the Universe are best unraveled through teamwork and open communication.

I love doing any kind of sports, in particuar I am a soccer passionate ⚽ and a gym regular 🏋️‍♂️.   

Feel free to explore my repositories to see some of the projects I've worked on. If you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!

Thank you for visiting my portfolio! 🚀✨
