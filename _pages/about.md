My name is Christian Magliano, and I am currently a PhD student in Astrophysics at the University of Naples. My academic journey and research interests revolve around some of the most fascinating aspects of the Universe:

- 🌍 **Exoplanets**: Discovering and studying planets beyond our Solar System, understanding their atmospheres, and assessing their potential habitability.
- 🌌 **Cosmology**: Exploring the large-scale structure of the Universe, its origins, evolution, and ultimate fate.
- 👽 **Astrobiology**: Investigating the possibility of life elsewhere in the Universe, combining knowledge from biology, chemistry, and planetary science.
To give a look at my academic publications, check out my [Publications](/publications/) page.

During my PhD, I have honed a variety of valuable skills, particularly in the realms of data analysis and visualization. Here are some of the key skills I have developed:

- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Proficient in handling and analyzing large datasets, extracting meaningful patterns, and deriving scientific insights.
- 📉 **Data Visualization**: Skilled in creating clear and informative visual representations of complex data, helping to communicate findings effectively.
- 🧪 **Scientific Research**: Conducting rigorous and methodical research, formulating hypotheses, and testing them through experiments and observations.
- 💻 **Programming**: I learned programming with Python, developing various scripts and tools to aid in my research. I am experienced with libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy.

I am generally interested in Science and I love working with big data and working sheets. In particular, I have a basic knowledge of Machine Learning, Data Engineering and Statistics which allows me to conduct a Data Analysis project within any field (science, finance, marketing, sport). To see some of the projects I have worked on, check out my [Portfolio](/portfolio/) page.
In addition to my technical skills, I am passionate about sharing knowledge and collaborating with fellow researchers. I believe that the mysteries of the Universe are best unraveled through teamwork and open communication.

I love doing any kind of sports, in particuar I am a soccer passionate ⚽ and a gym regular 🏋️‍♂️.
