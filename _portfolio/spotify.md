Spotify is a popular music streaming service that offers a vast library of songs, podcasts, and other audio content. Launched in 2008, Spotify allows users to listen to millions of tracks from various artists across the globe. Users can create and share playlists, discover new music through personalized recommendations, and access curated playlists for different moods and genres. Spotify offers both free and premium subscription options, with the latter providing benefits such as ad-free listening, offline downloads, and higher sound quality. It is accessible on multiple devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers, making it a versatile platform for music and audio entertainment.

In this project I have performed a complete Data Exploration of the most streamed Spotify songs up to 2024.  The dataset used in this project was retrieved on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pragyantiwari/spotify-refined-explicity-classified-1).
